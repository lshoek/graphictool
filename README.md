# graphictool

A modest yet powerful tool for real-time audioreactive visuals. Currently in one-off state and aimed for personal use, expected to be in development for future parties I will be hosting.

This application depends on [NAP 0.6](https://github.com/napframework) and a new `mod_naprenderadvanced` module which have not been publicly released yet. Please reach out to me if you are interested in using this software and I will consider backporting or publishing a Windows binary.
